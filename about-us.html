            <h2>Who I am</h2>
            <p>Ever since I can remember I've always had an fascination with Computers. </p>
          </div>
          <p>My name is Joseph Davis. I'm a self-taught and self-motivated designer, developer and IT technician who has a passion for all things in computing. I started programming at the age of 17 in high school with C++ since then Iâ€™ve learned Java, JavaScript, HTML, SQL, and PHP. I have plans of becoming an open-source contributor in the near future to further glow my profession.</p>
 <p>I would say that my greatest strength is that I'm highly adaptable. I'm always going out to learn about new technologies, how to solve problems faster and as efficiently as possible, and I'm always thinking in my feet.</p>
<p>When I'm not hard at work with any main or side projects my hobbies include: reading, my favorites genres are sci-fi and nonfiction, writing, just short prompt to writings online, nothing too elaborate, and build and repair old and new PCs.

        <h2>MY DESIGN PHILOSOPHY</h2>
        <p>Design is about making sophisticated solutions to communicate client's needs. The difficult situation is that most frequently we are planning for humans, and humans are complex. People's expectations and desires change at time. Sometimes innovation evolves to  satisfy those changes, sometimes design is the driver of the change. Regardless, the creator's job is never made. This does not mean the design wants to be trendy, design may be timeless, but the good designer has one tendency toward iteration and usually gets their attention to the ground.</p>
        <p>"Human-centered design is a design philosophy. It means starting with a good understanding of people and the need that the design is intended to meet. This understanding comes about primarily through observation, for people themselves are often unaware of the difficulties they are encountering."
</p>
        <p>Design thinking is an approach to creative problem solving that is widely recognized as a valuable course to human-centered product innovation. It has been called a methodology, a culture, and philosophy. Design thinking, fundamentally, recognizes that design should achieve purpose and business goals, not just beauty.
